    <!--<string "our_pledge"-->
    <string name="page_our_pledge">
        Maya Care aims to fulfil the growing need for
        enhancing the comfort of senior citizens living in India.
        During our interactions with senior citizens,
        each of us at Maya CARE pledge to conduct our
        duties based on these three simple values:
        I don the identity of a Maya CARE associate with pride.
        With the faith that today
        Will be a turning point in my life
        The day I chose to assume responsibility for a future
        Of new learning, self-reliance and dignity
        On this date, I pledge to CARE with:</string>

    <string name="title_integrity">Integrity </string>

    <string name="integrity_paragraph">
        Be honest in every transaction.
        If something has been missed out,
        admit our mistake and rectify it at the earliest. </string>

    <string name="title_responsibility">Responsibility</string>

    <string name="responsibility_paragraph">
        Ensure that the task undertaken
        is completed in the time frame committed.
        If the task cannot be accomplished due to an unavoidable reason,
        inform the service recipient of the same.</string>

    <string name="title_patience">Patience</string>

    <string name="patience_paragraph">
        Treat each service recipient with respect and make a
        sincere effort to understand the expectation in each transaction.</string>


    <!--<string "About_us"-->

    <string name="about_us_first_paragraph">
        Founded in 2009, Maya CARE is supported through
        personal funds by working professionals – Abhay
        Joshi and his wife Manjiri (Gokhale) Joshi. Maya
        CARE services are available FREE of charge. However,
        appreciation in the form of voluntary donations
        from individuals/groups/companies is welcome.</string>

    <string name="about_us_second_paragraph">
        Maya CARE has a network of co-ordinators and
        volunteers running help lines in Mumbai and Pune.
        Maya CARE volunteers include college students,
        homemakers, working professionals and active senior
        citizens who visit senior citizens in their own homes
        to provide services. None of us can ever replace a family
        member. But as professionals struggle to meet the demands
        of an active work life, each of us at Maya CARE have pledged
        to make up for their absence with integrity,
        responsibility and patience.</string>

    <!--<string "F.A.Q',s"-->
    <string name="title_first_faqs">
        Does Maya Care provide nurses/cooks?
        Can Maya Care guarantee emergency medical care?</string>

    <string name="first_paragraph_faqs">
        Maya CARE does not provide emergency,
        ayah/nursing or domestic servant services.
        Maya CARE volunteers are educated working/retired professionals,
        homemakers or students who gladly perform all the activities a family
        member would. Thus, Maya CARE volunteers sit with patients in hospital/at home, read to them,
        give medicine/help with physiotherapy exercises under medical advice.

    <string name="four_paragraph_faqs">
        It is mandatory for Maya CARE volunteers to carry a photo ID card bearing
        their name and the Maya Care logo. In case a volunteer is not carrying his/her
